# Python Basic Utility Project

This is a beginner-level Python project based on a **menu-driven program**.
The purpose of this project is to practice **functions, loops, conditional statements, and basic problem-solving logic**.

This project helped me build confidence in writing structured Python code.



# Features

The program provides the following options:

1. **Factorial of a Number**
   - Calculates the factorial using a loop and function.

2. **USD to INR Converter**
   - Converts US Dollars to Indian Rupees using a fixed conversion rate.

3. **Length of a List**
   - Finds the length of predefined lists.

4. **Print List Elements**
   - Prints all elements of a list in a single line.

5. **Exit**
   - Terminates the program.



# Concepts Used

- Python Functions  
- Loops (`for` loop)  
- Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- User Input  
- Menu-driven Programming
